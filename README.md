# ShortestPathFinder
# This project is design to find the shortest path on map by A*
# Improvement needed:
# 1. add button to select different H function to compare the difference results
# 2. add a new interface Shape which is the smallest unit on map. as a result, the redundant code in map can be moved
# to class shape. in addition, Shape can improve the expandability of map with different kinds of units.
# 3. add tick in the controller so that the process of finding the route will be shown out
